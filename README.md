*Curated awesome list of **LLM‑powered generative agents** for **city‑scale simulation** — research papers, code & resources. Focus on **urban simulation** and **social simulation.***

Thanks to the impressive planning, reasoning, and tool‑calling capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, people are actively studying and developing **LLM‑powered agents**. These agents can autonomously (and collaboratively) solve complex tasks, or simulate rich human interactions in virtual environments.

Our goal with this project is to build an exhaustive collection of awesome resources relevant to LLM‑powered agents—papers, repositories, datasets, and more. We strive to keep these updated regularly and continuously. **We greatly appreciate any contributions via PRs, issues, emails, or other methods.**

> **Maintenance note:** This repository is **not** under active maintenance. It mainly collects works that appeared **before June 2025**, with a handful of later additions. If you would like your paper included, please open a pull request.
